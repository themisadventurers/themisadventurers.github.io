unique: 'Unbeknownst to me, I was placed into this world as a child. I have no parents, for I was not born. Without this knowledge of my history, I&#39;m unable to harness the full power inside me; however, I do have a knack for being completely untraceable when it most suits me. I can&#39;t control this power, but it always seems to come to my aid when I need it.'
