<h3><em>What is 13th Age?</em></h3>

<p>13th Age is a fantasy tabletop roleplaying game (abbreviated RPG), much like the well-known Dungeons & Dragons. Following a set of rules, you build a unique character and play through adventures that take place in the 13th Age game setting. Using different sided dice, you roll for actions that could end in success or failure in real life, such as attacking a monster, picking a lock, or bribing a guard. Based on how you build your character, you can receive bonuses or penalties to these rolls that reflect your character’s strengths and weaknesses, respectively. A mercenary, for example, used to traveling with caravans along a dangerous road, is more likely to notice an ambush than a young apprentice wizard, who grew up studying indoors with his nose in his books.</p>

<p>Games normally consist of 4-6 players and a “Dungeon Master” (abbreviated DM). The DM runs the game; they prepare your adventure, using published material, their own material, or a combination of both. They play as the monsters you fight and the non-player characters (abbreviated NPCs) you will encounter. The DM will tell you who or what your character encounters, wait for your response, and then tell you the results of whatever actions your character attempted. Though you are responsible for knowing the basic rules of the system and your character’s information, the DM will regulate the rules for the game.</p>

<h3><em>What do I need to play?</em></h3>

<p>To play, you will need:
<ul><li>A set of 7 dice, usually called RPG dice or just a 7-dice set, including the following dice</li>
<ul>
  <li>one 4-sided die</li>
  <li>one 6-sided die</li>
  <li>one 8-sided die</li>
  <li>two 10-sided die (both are recommended, though only one is necessary)</li>
  <li>one 12-sided die</li>
  <li>one 20-sided die </li>
</ul>
<li>A copy of, or access to the 13th Age Core Rulebook</li>
<li>Paper and pencil to keep track of your character’s information, as well as important in-game notes</li>
<li>And of course, people to play with!</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>You can most likely find a copy of the 13th Age Core Rulebook in your local game or book store. Game stores often have dice sets as well. If you can’t find them locally, both can be found online. There are also many well-made, free character sheet templates available online. They make creating and keeping track of your character much easier for you and the DM. Using one is highly recommended.</p>

<h3><em>What makes 13th Age different from D&D and other RPGs?</em></h3>

<p>While both include rules and storytelling, D&D often contains specific statistics and rules that simulate reality (called a Simulationist game), whereas 13th Age leaves many decisions up to the DM and focuses more on embellishing the narrative of the game (called a Narrativist game). For example, in D&D there are specific rules about jumping over a pit that is x feet across, traveling in specific types of weather, fighting with your left hand while blindfolded, how long you can swim before drowning, etc. There are many obscure rules that are there for the DM to reference in almost any situation.</p>

<p>13th Age, on the other hand, only contains a few basic rules for building your character and for combat, and that’s about it. Everything else is left up to the DM. This creates an environment in which the story and characters are able to grow and develop more dynamically. With less number crunching, the combat system is also much faster. Neither type of game is better than the other, it is just a matter of personal taste; some prefer the more rules-heavy D&D and other RPGs, while others prefer the rules-light structure of 13th Age and others like it.</p>

<p>That being said, 13th Age is certainly more beginner-friendly. There have been people who were introduced to D&D (or another Simulationist game) only to be turned away by the amount of rules they felt like they had to memorize. 13th Age can be a great bridge for those who want to work their way to more complex RPGs.</p>

<p>All in all, 13th Age is very fun roleplaying game whose light rule system and emphasis on roleplaying lends itself well to beginners and seasoned adventurers alike.</p>
