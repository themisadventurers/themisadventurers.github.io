Orin's father was an accomplished blacksmith once he retired from the military. While Orin grew up, he helped his dad around the forge before becoming a full fledged apprentice. However, blacksmithing was not for Orin, and eventually he joined up in the town guard to hopefully get more adventure. Yet again, he was dissapointed. Instead, he signed on to the first roving caravan that came through, and he became a caravan guard. In his travels with the caravan, he met dwarves, elves, and the like. One night, while the caravan was camping, they fell victim to the servants of the Prince of Shadows, who descended upon the group, slaying nearly all of them instantly. Orin was one of the few lucky enough to escape, and he wandered around in the wild until he eventually found his way to a human settlement where he recovered from his wounds. It was here that he joined the unorthodox band of adventurers, and he traveled with them until his death.
