&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today was a glorious day for the Dwarf King! Many orcs have been felled in his name! Alas, let me start at the beginning...While I was still within that living dungeon, I was discovered by a few adventurers who also became trapped. Immediately, they recognized me, claiming they worked for the Elf Queen coming to "return what I stole". They didn't realized just how hopeless of a quest that was, however, I could not have made it out without their help. Perhaps I will recount more of the details of my experience in the dungeon over some ale back home in the mountains, but for now it is not important. Once we had escaped, the party decided they would escort me back to the Elf Queen, and frankly they did not leave me much choice. However, once we reached the Elf Queen, it seemed she had bigger problems as the Dwarf King has invoked the 2nd Age Treaty; it appears I have missed some events while I was in the dungeon. Apparently some orcs have been spotted roaming nearby lands and we were asked to deal with them. After wandering a bit we encoutered a small group of orcs near a creek, and quickly dispatched of them, however they apparently were not orcs we were looking for, so we continued on. Soon after we encountered a second party of adventurers, it seems we were not the only ones called by the Elf Queen. I noticed they were carrying with them the head of the very orc we were hunting, however our fool of a bard was quick to dismiss them. I cannot stay upset with him however, I was not too keen to do the Elf Queen's bidding. None the less upon returning we were sent out yet again, this time an elven fort was under attack and we were the reinforcements. Normally I wouldn't be opposed to a good fight, especially against orcs, but in order to get to the fort we had to fly on giant eagles. Brothers I have a new respect for those of us who undertake the more arcane arts and have experience flight, by I am certainly a dwarf of the ground. Nevertheless, we made the journey and fought the orcs among the treetop fort of the elves and ultimately slew every orc that challenged us. I recently recieved your report of the happenings of the temple and the Kings council, but I have yet to read it. I shall write again when I next have something to report.
