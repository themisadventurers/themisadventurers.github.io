<h2>Field Report</h2>
<h3>First Account of Duvin II,</h3>
<h3>Paladin, Order of the Stone</h3>
<br />
To the Council of Elders in Forge,
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fellow Dwellers, the Armor discovered by the elves has been reclaimed. The king should be satisfied, however, things have not gone quite as well as hoped. Upon my escape from the elven lands, I hid within what I thought was a simple dungeon, but by my beard it is much more. In all my years in the mines we dwarves have stumbled upon some strange things, but this is by far the strangest I've ever seen. From what I can tell, this dungeon is <em>alive</em>. I've never seen anything like; as I pass from one corridor to the next, the one behind me is replaced by another. I've been lost in here for hours now, fortunately I've only encountered lesser foes, but I did meet a human who was stuck here as I am. We stayed together for awhile, but we were seperated when he passed through a door that led to quite a fall. I'm not sure if I heard him hit a floor...Needless to say the armor is safe and in my possession, the problem will simply be returning it. At the time of writing I've lost track of just how long I've been here, however I do believe I've worked out some of the patterns of this dungeon. But while I've gotten used to navigating down here, the cursed place is still making go in circles, its just that now I recognize the circles I've gone in. I shall write again if and when I make it out.
<br />
