So I'm kinda new to this whole bard thing, after working as an entertainer back for all the royal elves back home i decided to start out on my own! picking up music is kind of a new thing for me, but screw it! I'm gonna do music! 
Although there is a problem...
I is terrible at writing, I'm more of an elf that uses his words! but the less amount of words I use the better.
But anywho! Me and my good friend Kasula go to a tavern to chill and all of the sudden this guy comes out saying he needs people to help him, to help out the Elf Queen. I think that is pretty sweet, but I was seriously just there! Anyway, of course I will the Queen but I try to get some beef rolls to help out...(beef rolls equals strong people to do all the fighting). I went off with the gang feeling good! (except that merc I had to pay but I can never tell him that). we fought some goblins (I think) and found out that crying during battle helps, who would have thought! also played some sweet jams that helped my crew.
Okay, we get this huge tower and I met the amazing, lovely Quellis. She was hotter than 100 dragon's flames, I would murder all my friends for her...oh wait thats a little dark, but you know what I mean. Quellis said some words about something weird going on in cave, I was a little distracted that whole conversation.
We go check out this cave and found out it was shady and there were a group of different of monsters all dead and stuff. I- or we, went back to the tower quickly (for different reasons), and.... thats when everything went downhill from there.
I could see my beautiful Quellis in the air fighting a mighty dragon and totally slaying the beast....and thats when the scum of the earth striked down Quellis... I had to run in there to see if she's okay.
Zanj or something like that was standing there with Glazentorg and killed her. We took down Zanj and killed the dragon, but Quellis was dead...the love of my life was dead.
We are going to the court of stars with the sword and I decided to bring Quellis with me hoping that the Elf Queen can do something about this.

PS. one of our guys also died in our group...Orin you were the badest of the bad, you will never be forgotten!
