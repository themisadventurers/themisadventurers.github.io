Alrighty so some crazy stuff happened one night. Me, Kasula, and Abra-Danny were all sleeping, and I had Quellis' body with me going to the court of stars and I has a crazy dream where Quellis spoke to me telling me to go get armor from some lame dwarf guy in a living dungeon. When I woke up she was gone! Although I did get an amazing lute that helped out with my sweet jams but everyone else disagrees. 
We starting walking out towards the courts and giant tunnel door thingy opened up. I'm getting kind of tired of this crap, now what makes it worse is that I have to help a dwarf! and he has the armor i need! Bard with the bad luck is what they're gonna start calling me.
So I have to drag this dwarf with me to get out of this maze because he is the only one that can actually transport us and move around...I never understood it myself. Also we Lost Abra-Danny....woops. I mean we found him, as he was being sacrificed, buy hey! gotta look at the small victories! of course we saved him and killed the creepy priest guy and got out of the dungeon thanks to my dear friend Kasula. Now I have to get this dwarf...Duvin, to the court of stars. He is not too bad of a guy, since he is religious type which means he is easy to trust because of morals or something silly like that...I can deal with him, for now.
