<p>It had been a few days since the incident at Boltstrike Pillar. As much as I had come to respect Quellis and Orin in the small amount of time I knew them, their bodies were becoming quite cumbersome for the three of us. We set up camp once again, but that night I had a strange vision.</p>

<p>A woman stood before me, her appearance shimmering between many people I had seen before. All were women who had spoken to me on behalf of the Elf Queen at some point. Her appearance finally settled to become Quellis. Then she spoke.</p>
<br>
<p><em>“I understand you are coming to the Court of Stars. The Elf Queen wishes for you to make a slight detour on your way. A dwarven paladin named Duvin has…”</em> she paused for a second, her face showing a hint of disdain, <em>“… borrowed… a valuable set of magical armor from the royal guard. The Queen would like you and your companions to retrieve the armor and the dwarf and bring them to the Court.</em></p>

<p><em>“We last tracked the dwarf to the entrance of what is known as a living dungeon. We believe he has taken refuge there. A living dungeon is a dungeon that is essentially, well, alive. No sure path is guaranteed; the path ahead and behind are constantly changing. No door leads to the same place twice, and many have been lost in such dungeons. The entrance to this dungeon was last seen a few miles east of where you are currently. I wish you the best of luck.”</em> With that she disappeared.</p>

<p>That morning I woke, and lying beside my head were two daggers. The blades were crossed neatly, polished like new. I glanced around at the party. Daniel was still asleep, but Fard appeared to have just woken up, and was holding what looked like a new lute. As it turns out, he had received a similar vision that night.</p>

<p>It was then that we realized our comrades’ bodies were gone. In Quellis’s place was a pile of ashes. I wondered if it had something to do with our vision. Orin’s body, however, appeared to have been dragged off into the brush and mostly eaten by a bear during the night. Normally I would have woken at the slightest noise, but the vision must have put me into a deep, sedated sleep. Oops.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">~~~</p>

<p>Our party set out in the general direction that dream-Quellis had indicated. We searched all day, and by evening I was starting to think this had been some sort of hoax. All of the sudden the ground began to shake and a giant stone door erupted from the ground right in front of us. It seems we had found the dungeon, or perhaps the dungeon found us.</p>

<p>Entering the dungeon, we immediately stumbled upon a heated battle. A heavily armored dwarf wielding a hammer was fighting several huge flying bugs. Guessing that this was our “borrower”, Duvin, we reluctantly jumped into the fray. However, we soon realized we were fighting boom bugs – creatures that explode when killed. Though more injured than we’d like, we worked together and finished them off.</p>

<p>It was indeed Duvin. Talking with him, we learned that he had been there for a while. He knew his way around, and we didn’t. I realized we’d have to keep an eye on him, or we’d never get out of this place. Fard was set on turning him over to the Queen, but I was willing to strike a deal, even with a dwarf. Duvin agreed to help us out of the dungeon – for the time being.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">~~~</p>

<p>Our party, with our newest addition, wandered the dungeon for a while. We eventually came to an eerily clean room, with an altar in the middle. A man, strangely calm and cheery, was there and said he knew how to get out of the dungeon. I didn’t trust him. He said by the power of prayer, we could go wherever we liked. He bowed his head and began to pray, then was gone, just like that. Before I could raise much objection, I noticed Duvin beginning to pray. I quickly grabbed hold of his shoulder and reached for Fard just in time, as the three of us were whisked away.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we simply found ourselves somewhere else in the endless maze of a dungeon. To make things even better, Fard and I realized that Daniel hadn’t made it with us. The fool must have been daydreaming – he’d been strangely distant the whole day. Couldn’t he pay attention?</p>

<p style="text-align:center">~~~</p>

<p>Duvin prayed us back to the altar room, but we were met with an unpleasant surprise. The man we met earlier was back, standing over the altar with a knife. His eyes were wide and he had a crazed expression on his face. He began to change into some dark-skinned, wild-looking dwarf-like creature, revealing his true form. I didn’t have to look at the body tied up on the altar to know it was Daniel.</p>

<p>Fard, Duvin and I rushed the man. Our focus turning to the outside of the room, we realized he had four acolytes with him. Someone was able to cut Daniel free, and he finally snapped to attention, using his magic to aid us. At least he was finally doing something. The battle was tough, but we finally defeated the priest and his followers. The dwarf was proving himself a useful fighter.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">~~~</p>

<p>After our minds cleared from the fight, we noticed the doors in the room were different from before. To the north (or what I thought might be north) was a white door, emanating light. On the opposite side of the room was a dark door, seemingly oozing shadows. The light door appeared nice, but something about the door felt wrong. I felt pulled towards the shadowy door, though I do not know why. Convincing them to follow, I led the way.</p>

<p>The darkness in the hallway was oppressive. So thick you could almost feel it. Daniel’s hand clutched my shoulder, and I assumed the others had formed a line in similar fashion. I just continued forward, unsure why I felt this was the way. I began to feel something forming between my shoulder and Daniel’s hand, and I heard him cry out. Suddenly, I tripped and the rest stumbled after me. I landed in grass, and realized there was sunlight. Looking up, we saw we had made it back to the surface. No sign of the dungeon was left, not even the door.</p>

<p>I felt my shoulders, and found that I was now wearing a cloak.  It was a beautiful deep black, reminiscent of the darkness we had just come through. At least something good had come from our trip in that bizarre dungeon. I turned to the others to see a heated debate going on between Fard and Duvin. I studied the dwarf. He was very stubborn, and too strong even for all three of us to overpower. He could be of use to us, perhaps. We would get him to come.</p>
