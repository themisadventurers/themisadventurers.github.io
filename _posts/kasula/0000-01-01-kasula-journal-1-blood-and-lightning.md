<p>While attending to some business in Concord, I visited a local tavern called <em>The Harping Minstrel</em>. There I ran into Fard, a good friend of mine. We have both been in service of the Elf Queen, and have crossed paths often. Suddenly a man burst through the door, interrupting our chat. He loudly announced to the whole tavern, in the name of the Elf Queen, that she was seeking volunteers to go on a mission to a place called Boltstrike Pillar.</p>

<p><em>Odd</em>, I thought, <em>that she would choose a pesky human to carry this information</em>. Though it is not for me to question her ways; if he truly was her messenger, it would be in my best interest to answer her call. If he was not, well, it would also be in my best interest to rat out the skeevy man and further my relationship with the Elf Queen.</p><br/>

<p>Fard, an easy-going and impressionable fellow, was happy to heed the call. With just a gangly bard as my traveling companion, and not loving the front lines of battle myself, I decided it would be wise to seek a few allies to accompany us. Besides the tavern’s more ordinary occupants, we saw a half-orc mercenary sitting alone in the dark corner of the tavern, quietly observing everything going on. We also spotted a portly wizard (who I identified by his garb) and brawny human hefting an axe sitting together not far away.</p>

<p>While they weren’t my preferred company, they were the best the tavern had to offer. The wizard (named AbracaDaniel) and the barbarian (named Orin) were easily convinced to come. The mercenary (named Rorek) finally took Fard’s bribe of half his share of the reward. Perhaps I can get Fard to barter his other half.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">~~~</p>

<p>The first leg of the trek was uneventful. On our third day, Rorek expertly spotted a goblin ambush just in time to give us warning before the pathetic critters jumped us. Seeing a goblin shaman in the back, I took aim. AbracaDaniel, however, beat me to it and felled their leader with a powerful Acid Arrow spell. Despite the look of surprise on his face at seeing his magic manifest so strongly, I decided to start keeping a closer eye on the unassuming wizard. We made quick work of the rest of the goblins, and continued our way to Boltstrike Pillar.</p><br/>

<p>Greeting us at the entrance to the tower was a half-elf named Zanj, second-in-command at Boltstrike Pillar. Again, I had not known the Elf Queen to even employ half-elves, let alone humans, but perhaps he was valuable to her. The leader of the tower, Quellis was a stately, fairly attractive high-elven woman. Fard was immediately infatuated with her. He eagerly babbled about our happenings while Quellis remained stoic throughout his stuttered report.</p>

<p>What alarmed her most about our report was the goblin ambush. Boltstrike Pillar was protected by wizards and diviners who were able to detect potential attacks, yet somehow they had not known about this band of goblins. Quellis immediately called for the tower’s magicians to perform a more thorough divination of the surrounding lands, and offered us a place to sleep while the ritual took place.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">~~~</p>

<p>Later that evening, Zanj called us together. The wizards had found a small band of goblins in a nearby cave, he said, and Quellis wanted us to clear it out. He explained that the cave was normally a well-hidden ambush site, but after learning from a few attacks, the wizards set up traps in the cave system. Not nearly as intelligent, the goblins and other enemies continued to use this site for their doomed ambushes. Zanj gave us directions to the cave, and we set out.</p><br/>

<p>At the cave, we did not find the expected enemy force. Not <em>alive</em>, anyways. Goblin bodies were strewn everywhere about the entrance. AbracaDaniel uttered the command word, but it appeared the traps had already been set off. We cautiously picked our way through the mess and into the mouth of the cave. Within the cave, we found lizardmen bodies, tracks, and a giant dragon’s footprint. Wonderful. Heeding the clear warning sign, we made haste back to the tower.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">~~~</p>

<p>We braced ourselves as the grim scene that was Boltstrike Pillar came into view. A giant blue dragon circled overhead, raining its lightning breath down on the tower’s occupants. Suddenly Quellis rose up from inside the tower and shot a huge fireball at the dragon, blazing a hole right through one of its wings. The crippled dragon plummeted to the ground. We then watched in horror as Zanj rose up behind Quellis and brutally struck her down. Fard sprinted to the tower, screaming in anger, and the rest of us followed close behind.</p><br/>

<p>At the top of the tower, we were greeted by a terrible sight. Zanj, in the frenzy of some bizarre ritual, was repeatedly stabbing Quellis’s dying body. We quickly charged the power-crazed half-elf, turning his attention onto us. Just when we thought we were about to defeat him, Zanj leapt back and dealt the killing blow to Quellis.</p>

<p>On completion of the ritual, strange power surged into his body, and Zanj transformed into a huge, shadowy dragon-like beast. I seized the opportunity to climb my way up the creature’s back using my daggers, bringing them to rest quite nicely in either side of his neck. The treacherous monster thrashed in pain and took flight, only to be ended by another stab of my daggers midair. We began to fall to the ground, and as if in response to my imminent danger, I suddenly found the ability to teleport to safety at the last minute. I cannot say where this power came from; only that it felt eerily familiar and I somehow knew exactly what to do.</p>

<p>Realizing we had left a wounded and angry dragon at the base of the tower, I fastened a hook and rope to a broken window and repelled down the wall, the party following suit. I was able to jump and land on the dragon’s neck, stabbing one of its eyes with a dagger. I hung on for dear life as it swung at my companions. I witnessed Orin’s unfortunate end as the dragon dealt a devastating blow to the poor bloke. Rorek finally stabbed the dragon, killing it and ending the long battle. We were victorious, though at a steep price.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">~~~</p>

<p>Bearing the bodies of our fallen comrades, Orin and Quellis, we decided to go to the Court of Stars. Rorek parted ways with us, leaving on personal mercenary business. I hope that meeting with the Elf Queen will clear up this interesting plot we seemed to have found.</p>
