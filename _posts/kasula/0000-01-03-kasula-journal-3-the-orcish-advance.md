<p>Our party reached the small town of Summervale. There was quite a bit of commotion, which was unusual for the normally small, quiet village. As it happens, the Elf Queen was visiting. Not only that, but there seemed to be some kind of disturbance. We made our way through the crowd towards the Elf Queen, who was stationed with her generals and advisors on a raised area near the center of town. </p>

<p>At the bottom of the stage, handing a scroll to the Queen, we spotted our previous companion, Rorek. The Queen read it, and then made an announcement to the people. The Dwarf King, a reluctant ally to the elves, had invoked the 2nd Age treaty. An orc army was soon to pass through elven territory on its way to the dwarves in Forge. The Queen requested the aid of any group or individuals willing to search the area for the orcish scouting groups heading the army. Many volunteered, ourselves included, but one group in particular caught my eye. Three there were, each wearing a differently colored, long, hooded robe. One clothed in blue robes, another in black, and the apparent leader in red robes. I couldn’t make out their faces from where we stood, but something about the group was unsettling. As people began leaving the clearing, either returning to their business or heading out of town to begin the search, I lost sight of the group. I put them out of my mind for the moment, as we reunited with Rorek and left town.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">~~~</p>

<p>Once on the outskirts of town, we began to talk about how to find these orc scouts. Daniel insisted he could track them, with his infinite knowledge of nature, and so we let him take point. My mind had wandered back to those robed adventurers, and being deep in thought I didn’t see what was going on in front of me until it was too late. The entire party stumbled into a river, poisoned with a dead body. We fought off our nausea, and continued. My thoughts were preoccupied and the afternoon was a blur; I vaguely remember wolves and squirrels. Finally I became fed up with wandering in circles and accomplishing nothing. I scaled a nearby tree and spotted a group of orc scouts. I then left Rorek in charge of leading the party on the ground. I am no lover of half-orcs, but at least I could trust the man with responsibilities. It was more than I could say for the rest of the group.</p>

<p>We tracked the scouting party to a campsite; not theirs, but another group of orcs who had already been slain. They noticed our presence and attacked, their two battle criers beating their war drums for aid. The battle was over quickly enough. We caught our breath and searched the area. I began looking outside the camp area for any remaining orc scouts. When I returned, I just caught sight of the three robed figures leaving through the woods, holding a large orc’s head. The chieftan’s, I guessed, by its size and the fact that they held it proudly. When I asked the others, I found out that Fard had dismissed them when they didn’t respond to his friendliness. That simpleton! A chance to see them closer and I had missed it! None of the others had stepped in. Even Rorek hadn’t stopped them.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">~~~</p>

<p>The five of us returned to see the group of three being congratulated by the Queen herself. Royal guards presented a large bag of reward money to each of the three. I was seething. This party of blockheads I was with had sent these people on their way with a head worth at least three bags of gold! The rest of the participants were sent en masse to claim our pitifully small amount of reward money.</p>

<p>Everyone was unexpectedly called to attention once again. The Queen had just received news that an elven outpost, called Briarfort, was under siege by an unusually strong group of orcs. The fort was overwhelmed and unable to defend against the passing army. Volunteers were called for again, and again we answered the call. As did the robed trio. Those willing to help were called to the stage. I finally came close enough to examine the three figures. Two I didn’t recognize, but their leader was none other than Skarn! I <em>knew</em> that man was suspicious from the very beginning! Before anything could be said or done, they were carried off by eagles, as were we moments later.</p>

<p>Our eagle mounts dispatched us atop Briarfort, where large ladders were propped against the outside walls. A battle was taking place below, obscured by the treetops. I quickly realized we had lost sight of the other group during the flight, and they were nowhere to be seen now. My concerns would have to wait, however, as orcs from below began scaling the ladders. The party jumped to action.</p>

<p>The orc soldiers were proving to be only a small challenge, but their leader soon arrived, riding a huge wolf-like beast. After a deadly blast from our wizard, the leader turned on his attacker. We had to cut through the other soldiers to come to his aid, and by then it was almost too late. Fard was able to aid him just in time, pouring a potion down Daniel’s throat. Meanwhile, Rorek and I drew the leader’s attacks, which were beginning to take their toll on both of us. Exhausted, we finally finished the brute off.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">~~~</p>

<p>Tonight I lay awake. But not from the recent battle. Something about the group of three is nagging me, but I still cannot put my finger on it. Their garb is strange for this area, and strangely ceremonial for trekking through the woods hunting orcs. There was a red, a black and a blu—</p>

<p><em>Blast!!</em> How could I have not seen it before?? <span style="text-decoration:line-through">The three!</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">The <em>Three!!!</em></span> Kasula, you fool. My many years as a spy and I couldn’t see something as obvious as daylight. This is most certainly a disturbing revelation. If they are indeed working for The Three, how could they have entered such a well-protected and patrolled town? Even more so at a time when the Elf Queen was visiting, when patrols and guards would have been doubled, if not tripled? These emissaries, cultists, maybe even spies for The Three were simply waltzing through an elven village near the heart of the Queen’s Wood, completely unnoticed. Or at least, I assumed they were unnoticed. The Queen and her company have shown no signs of recognizing this connection. But why?</p>

<p>One option would be that these people are completely innocent, and have already been cleared or recognized by an authority. This still does not explain the trio's suspicious behavior, however, and I do not feel like their choice in color is some sort of coincidence.</p>

<p>Assuming they <em>are</em> working for The Three, another option is that no one, not even the Queen, has actually noticed. This also seems highly unlikely, as it would take very powerful magic to conceal something like this from the Court wizards, much less the Queen herself.</p>

<p>The third option, assuming they <em>are</em> working for The Three, and the Elf Queen <em>does</em> know who they are... Well, I do not want to jump to conclusions too soon, but I fear something very foul is afoot.</p>
