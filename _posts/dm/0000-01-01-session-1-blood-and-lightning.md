### Session Start: _The party assembled themselves in The Harping Minstrel in Concord to adventure for the Elf Queen._
### Session End: _After enduring the events at Boltstrike Pillar, and the loss of a newfound friend, the party heads to the Court of Stars to seek audience with the Elf Queen._

## Summary
> Starting in a tavern, as all good adventures do, the party encountered a human emissary of the Elf Queen named Skarn. Skarn sent the party to Boltstrike Pillar, a Wizard's tower in possession of a magical scimitar that needed to be transported to the Elf Queen. Ambushed on the way to the tower, they raised concern because the wizards of the tower had not seen a goblin presence in the area. After some targeted divinations, the wizards of Boltstrike Pillar found another camp of goblins and hobgoblins and the party was sent to investigate the camp. Alas, the camp was a diversion to lure the party away from Boltstrike so that Zanj could launch his attack. When the party discovered this diversion, it was almost too late. With haste, they returned to the tower just in time to see Quellis blast the blue dragon from the sky. Zanj, weilding Glazentorg the magical scimitar, struck Quellis down and began brutally murdering her and using her magic to transform into a Half-Dragon Mutant. Fortunately, the party was able to dispatch him, but not before Quellis lost her life. After dealing with Zanj, the party took to finishing off the blue dragon which killed Orin just moments before losing its own life.

## This Session's Misadventure
> Deceived by Zanj and Skarn, the party was directed away from Boltstrike Pillar when Boltstrike needed them most. Sent away on a simple reconnaissance mission, the party was just headed back as Boltstrike was attacked by a blue dragon and its lizardmen minions. After fighting to retake Boltstrike from Zanj and the blue dragon, Orin was felled: slain my a mighty blow from the blue dragon.

## What's Up With Each Character
### [AbracaDaniel]({{baseurl}}/party/AbracaDaniel)
Possibly more excited to be included on this adventure than he is infatuated with the High Druid, Daniel mainly spent his time revelling in his newfound friendships. During the goblin ambush on the way to Boltstrike Pillar, Daniel destroyed the leader of the goblins with a single Acid Arrow. Trusted by the Wizards of Boltstrike Pillar to set off the magical traps at the caves that the goblins were hiding out in, Daniel was quintessential to the success of this mission. As the party traversed the goblin hideout, they set off a trap of unknown origin. When this happened, a burst of magical energy washed over the party. Everyone came out fine, but Daniel's dagger began vibrating - and it hasn't stopped since.
### [Fard]({{baseurl}}/party/Fard)
Fard rediscovered love each time he saw Quellis. Before even talking to her, he had already envisioned their lives together. It was he who jumped so quickly at the chance to impress Quellis, and he that swayed the party to check out the caves. It was he who was sent to the heights of ecstasy when Quellis struck a mighty blow to the blue dragon and to the depths of despair when Quellis was struck down. Fard was riding the emotional rollercoaster that day. Fighting through tears, he kept up enough will to finish the fight with his party, choosing only to mourn fully after the dragon was defeated.
### [Kasula]({{baseurl}}/party/Kasula)
Relatively unamused by the adventure and her companions up to this point, Kasula took excitement where she could find it. As Zanj transformed into the Dragon-Thing, she seized the opportunity to climb up the creatureâ€™s back using her daggers, bringing them to rest quite nicely in either side of its neck. The treacherous monster thrashed in pain and took flight, only to be ended by another stab of her daggers midair. As the two began to fall to the ground entangled with each other, Kasula suddenly found the ability to teleport to safety at the last minute.
### [Orin]({{baseurl}}/graveyard/Orin)
Orin was repeatedly hit with staggering blows - first by Zanj, then by the transformed Dragon-Zanj-Thing, and finally by the rampaging blue dragon - each blow enough to kill a lesser man twice over. Enraged, the struck blow after blow to each enemy he faced. Finally, Orin took a blow from a swipe of the dragon's claws at a critical location - felling him once and for all.
### [Rorik]({{baseurl}}/party/Rorik)
Rorik stoically allowed Fard to promise away half his adventure spoils in return for the mercenary's services. A keen eye with previous adventuring experience, Rorik was easily able to spot the goblins waiting in ambush which allowed the party to make quick work of them. He also identified tracks in and about the goblin hideout and realized quickly that they were from a large blue dragon. Finally, after the death of his companion Orin, Rorik grimly slew the dragon.
