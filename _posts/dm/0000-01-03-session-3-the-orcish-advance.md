### Session Start: _The party reached the Elvish town of Summervale, on the border of the Queen's Wood._
### Session End: _The adventurers arrive at Briarfort in the nick of time, successfully driving off the Orcs that were storming the keep._

## Summary
> After escaping the living dungeon, the party proceeded as planned to the Elf Queen's Court. They stopped in Summervale, a small town on the edge of the Queen's Wood where they found the Elf Queen herself and her travelling nobility. Rorek was also there, delivering a letter from the Dwarf King. The Elf Queen, upon reading of the Dwarf King's invocation of the 2nd Age Treaty, requested the help of the adventurers in doing some reconnaissance on the passing Orcish scouts. The party obliged, and after stumbling around in the Wood for some time, they finally found a group of orcs. Alas, however, as these orcs were not in any way associated with the marching army. Shortly after defeating the orcs the party met up with another group of adventurers, no doubt sent by someone else called to honor the 2nd Age Treaty invocation, this time bearing the head of an orc whose helmet bore the symbol of the Orc Lord but Fard cheerily sent them away with no contest for the head. Upon returning to Summervale for the celebration of the adventurers who returned with the head, the party realized their error. A chance to redeem themselves was presented by the Elf Queen, though, when she asked for volunteers to travel, eagleback, to Briarfort. Briarfort, an Elvish fort currently under seige by what seemed to be "orc special ops", was so overwhelmed that they were helpless to stop the orc army marching by. The party, along with the adventuring group that returned with the head, volunteered and were immediately swept up by eagles. Dropped in the middle of the fort in the middle of a heated battle there wasn't much time for anyone to look around or get their bearings, but one thing that the party did notice was that the other adventuring party never arrived. Defeating the orcs wasn't too much trouble for the party, and they soon had driven the orcs out of Briarfort and saved the elves.

## This Session's Misadventure
> When fighting the orcs at the scouting camp, AbracaDaniel really let loose, dropping three of them with one shout and a shake of his staff! Unfortunately for him, he became the prime target and was quickly felled. He tried to shake death three times but failed to do so each time, finally to be saved just in time by Fard pouring a potion down his throat. Singing the same song, second verse, AbracaDaniel shot an evoked Acid Arrow at the leader of the orc special ops team in Briarfort and drew his attention, falling yet again. 

## What's Up With Each Character
### [AbracaDaniel]({{baseurl}}/party/AbracaDaniel)
The night before the party was meant to track the orcs, as AbracaDaniel was sleeping, his dagger came to life! Suddenly, it spoke: "I see you've found one of my daggers." Daniel immediately recognized the voice of the High Druid's. As he proclaimed his intent to return it, she responded "It is yours now, one of many like it." The next day, Daniel was a bit more shaken than usual and while trying to find the orc scouting party he lead the party straight into a disguisting, stinky river containing a few stale dead bodies. 
### [Duvin]({{baseurl}}/party/Duvin)
Duvin took over, after the party dried themselves off, and was thoughtfully considering the way to go next to track the orcs. Unfortunately, the party stood around for too long and the stench of death on them attracted a pack of wolves that attacked the party, but quickly ran after seeing the might of the party. In both orc fights Duvin stood tall and strong, felling many orcs and never once falling himself. 
### [Fard]({{baseurl}}/party/Fard)
Fard attempted to scare the wolves away (after they were already running off) and instead he accidentally attracted all the squirrels in the wood, which subsequently stampeded the party. When Fard encountered the opposing adventurers he raised a friendly hand and called out to them. However, when they spurned his friendly advances and spoke to him with contempt he shooed them away quickly. 
### [Kasula]({{baseurl}}/party/Kasula)
Kasula shot to the top of a tree (much like a squirrel) after the squirrel stampede to try to get the party back on track. Fortunately, she was able to spot the orc scouting party setting fires in the Wood to try to hinder adventurers searching for them. This information was priceless to the party as Kasula was able to lead them safely out of the path of the fires.  
### [Rorek]({{baseurl}}/party/Rorik)
Rorek brought the news of the Dwarf King's invocation of the 2nd Age Treaty to the Elf Queen and rejoined his party. He also came bearing important information about the Orc forces that the Dwarf King had him recover and compile into a report to be sent out to all major imperial leaders. As reward, the Dwarf King instructed him to keep Glazentorg, and to tell the Elf Queen, if asked, "You have owed me for a long time, let my agent keep his sword. Even still, you have not repaid your debt."
