### Session Start: _The party is headed for the Elf Queen's Court with Orin and Quellis' bodies in tow._
### Session End: _The party has recovered Duvin, the Dwarven Paladin, from the living dungeon and are once again headed for the Elf Queen's Court._

## Summary
> After a vision from Quellis, the diminished party (Fard, Kasula, and AbracaDaniel) set out in search of a living dungeon rumored to be the home of a dwarven refugee who was wanted by the Elf Queen. After wandering around the dungeon for some time and encountering some strange individuals, the party found a priest in a altar room whose decor was unlike the rest of the dungeon. This priest taught them "the power of prayer" which could be used to teleport anywhere within the dungeon as long as you knew what your destination looked like. While testing this out, the party lost Daniel to the priest! It was only after fighting the priest and saving Daniel that the party was able to escape the living dungeon.

## This Session's Misadventure
> Fard, Kasula, and Duvin prayed themselves away, leaving Daniel all alone with the creepy priest. When they returned, Daniel and the priest were gone! As they raced around the dugeon trying to find Daniel, the rooms and passageways became more and more confusing. Finally, upon a stroke of great luck, they stumbled back into the altar room to the sight of Daniel strapped to the altar, with the priest chanting over him. 

## What's Up With Each Character
### [AbracaDaniel]({{baseurl}}/party/AbracaDaniel)
After starting the session a bit absentmindedly, AbracaDaniel got kidnapped by a weird, creepy priest who attempted to sacrifice his body to an unknown god. Fortunately for Daniel, the party was able to rescue him just in time!
### [Duvin]({{baseurl}}/party/Duvin)
Wanted by the Elf Queen for borrowing a set of stubborn armor ages ago and then being too stubborn to return it, Duvin was the light in the darkness of this dungeon. After living in the dungeon so long, he had most of the passageways figured out and was able to lead Fard and Kasula around until they rescued Daniel. 
### [Fard]({{baseurl}}/party/Fard)
Overjoyed at the sight of Quellis, his love, Fard never had any doubt about accepting the mission to recover the dwarf and has no plans to do anything but turn him in to the Elf Queen as soon as possible. As a reward for his faithful servitute, Fard was gifted a tone deaf lute that loves to sing. 
### [Kasula]({{baseurl}}/party/Kasula)
Gifted suspicious daggers by the Elf Queen before delving into the dungeon, Kasula never could quite trust Duvin though she let him guide her through the dungeon. After rescuing Daniel, she trusted in her relationship with the Prince of Shadows to guide them through a shadowy passage out of the dungeon, acquiring a pompous shadowy cloak during her passage which she can only hope is a gift.
### [Rorik]({{baseurl}}/party/Rorik)
Rorik spent this session off on his own doing mercenary things. #Lame.
