##Business Endeavour Number 267
###Objective: Retrieve sword from Elven Outpost and return it to the Court of Stars
###Observations:
Jobs just never seem to be as excitin' once you have opened up a treasure room filled with gold and magical items, or repelled a wave of demons from a stronghold and spent the rest of the week celebratin' with the swordsmen that helped ya do it. But I'm not one to complain when work comes my way, especially when they pay you a little extra. This job was simple: retrieve the sword and take it back to the Elves' shot-callers. No job is ever simple though.

The group I was with consisted of two elves that seemed to be the ones who wanted to get in good with the higher-ups, a strange wizard, and a capable looking barbarian. With five members in our party, we made it to the tower easily, and would have been in and out too, except the Elves weren't finished with their fancy magic which was "required" for the sword. Typical High Elves takin' their time. They told us that we should go investigate some tunnels that goblins had been seen in, just as a precaution. It seemed like the orders of a paranoid treehugger until we found the footprints of a dragon. The outpost was in a lot more immediate danger than we were led to believe. We got back to the tower to see the head elf knock the dragon right out of the sky. It would have been real impressive too, if she hadn't let her guard down and allowed some back-stabbin' guard to get the jump on her. When she started fallin', one of our's (an elf who had become a little too attached) immediately ran into the tower. We got to the top and found the traitor and the sword which he was wieldin'. Glazentorg, an incredible, powerful scimitar, was one weapon that I would not have minded keepin' on me. But even with the powerful weapon, the traitor came up a little short. What looked like his last act was to finish off the head elf, which transformed him into a nightmarish beast. Fortunately, he dropped his sword which I took posession of as quickly as I could. His new form didn't help him any more than his first did and he was finished by some impressive acrobatics from our elven rogue. The last order of business was the dragon at the bottom of the tower, unfortuneately this fight didn't turn out so well. At the last few moments before we killed the damn lizard it had just enough strength to launch a lethal assault on the barbarian. He seemed like a fine swordsman. I finished the dragon with the opening the barbarian had left me and began consulting with the party on our next move. However, my time with them was cut short upon receiving a job from the Dwarf King about some orc. I headed out immediately, seeing as I would rather help out the Dwarf King than the Elf Queen. I must have been a couple mile away by the time I realized that Glazentorg was still on my belt.

###Outcome: Job went sideways, but Glazentorg as a sword in an acceptable payment
