##Business Endeavour Number 268 continued
###Objective: Run recon on the Orc forces that are on the edge of The Dwarf King's territory
###Observations:
Fate has an interestin' way of working its magic. When I was tasked with deliverin' a message to the Court of Stars right after I had "acquired" Glazentorg from one of their outposts, I thought that my days in this life were less than the few minutes that a sunset hangs on the horizon. Thankfully, The Dwarf King must have future plans for me.

I learned that the Elf Queen would be in Summervale, and I thought that an audience with her might prove to be a little more simple than if I had caught her in the Court of Stars. One would think that a diplomatic package from The Dwarf King would warrent at least a quick meetin'. It might be the unfriendly nature that mercenaries hold, or it could just be that elves have sticks so far up their asses that they wouldn't imagine company with non-elves somethin' that was worth their time. But I suppose that there are a couple select elves that can pull their weight, namely my previous companions. They found me trying to convince the queen's guards to let me through, when Kasula and Fard walked up, said 'bout two words to them, and off we went to see the Queen. Deliverin' the letter was easy enough, but its contents were a mixture of really good news and semi-good news. It seemed that my recon of the Orcish forces confirmed their suspicions of eminent raids against the Elf Queen and Dwarf King territories. The Dwarf King had invoked what they called the 2nd Age Treaty, which basically called for the two forces to work together against the Orcs. The Dwarf King also called the Elf Queen to allow me to keep Glazentorg as payment for my work in the recon. The really good news was I was keeping Glazentorg and I wouldn't be imprisoned for it. The news that was still good was that a series of offenses against the Orcs would probably lead the elves to call on volunteers to fight, for a small fee of course. 

###Outcome: I keep holding onto Glazentorg, my head, and get a job fightin' off the Orcs


##Business Endeavour Number 269
###Objective: Repel Orc forces
###Observations:
The Queen was quick to respond and I've got to admit that the elves organization was impressive. We headed off tasked with taking out the Orc scouts and I'm sure that a fat, and flightless dragon would have tracked down the Orcs faster and more efficiently than we did. We fell into a pit, fought off wolves, and eventually started runnin' around in circles. Kasula showed some competence by climbing a tree and finding a pack of Orcs. We fought them off, only to realize that it was the wrong group of Orcs. Another group of mercenaries found the captain before we could. We returned and were given at least a small sum of gold, though it wasn't near enough for what we went through. Lucky for us, the Orcs had assaulted another elf stronghold called Briarfort. We arrived to see the place in pretty bad shape, but we didn't have time to take in the sights. Orcs were quick to attack our position and were even more quickly repelled, until some mean lookin, son of a hag Half-Orc showed up ridin' an even more ferocious wolf. This was an opponent that proved to be quite a challenge for even my entire party. But whats a war without a couple of near death experiences every day?
