<h2 class="AbracaDaniel-handwriting">Dear Diary,</h2> 

I guess the battle yesterday took more out of me than I thought it did. I woke up today so sleepy I almost couldn't see! Let alone think. The adventure continued on...

Apparently, Kasula and Fard got some kind of vision that we needed to go somewhere to get something and I don't really know I was still asleep. Anywho, we go to this super weird and creepy, "living dungeon." We find the guy we were sent for. His name was Duvin. I guess he stole something from the Elf Queen? I don't know, he seemed nice. So he joins the party temporarily, and we continue to look for some weirdo Cleric. 

And we eventually find him. He seems to have the power to teleport wherever he wants in the dungeon through "the power of prayer." _Sounds like a lot of hooie if you ask me._ Kasula and Fard wanted to try it out and it works. They end up taking Duvin with them. I'm not sure why they didn't grab me. I guess they thought that I'd pray myself there. Well I didn't. 

I didn't really know what to do. I looked at the Cleric for a clue. Something seemed off. His demeanor had completely changed. As the rest of my friends were whisked away to another part of the dungeon, the Cleric lunged at me and bashed my head against a wall...

I woke up to a familiar face. His eyes were glazed over as if his mind was elsewhere. He was chanting something in a language I didn't recognize. It must have been magic. 

Suddenly, the chanting stopped. His eyes refocussed. He stared at me. I was so scared, I didn't realize that my hands weren't bound. 

"Are you ready?"

_Ready for what?_

"Ready to realize your true potential....to become the conduit?"

I still couldn't answer. I almost didn't want to. If I didn't answer, the ritual couldn't continue. 

"We are almost finished with preparations.....he will be here soon....."

As the ritual continued, the rest of the party found there way into the same chamber. When they saw the danger, they sprang to action. With their help, I was able to escape the mad Cleric and defeat him. I was finally safe. We somehow managed to get out of the living dungeon through a strange misty portal that Kasula felt drawn to. 

As we left, I noticed that everyone was admiring a new posession that they had somehow gained from exploring the dungeon. I felt somewhat cheated, but I was happy to be alive. Our next destination is the Court of Stars, where we will decide the fate of the thief, Duvin. I'm not sure what I'll do, since he saved my life. I'll have to sleep on it.
