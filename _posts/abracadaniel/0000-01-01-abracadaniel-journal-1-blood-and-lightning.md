<h2 class="AbracaDaniel-handwriting">Dear Diary,</h2>

Today was a very exciting day indeed! Today was the day I decided to leave home in search of the High Druid. I've had this dagger for more than a month now, and she never came and got it...no matter how many postings I left in the town square. 

I found my way to a quaint tavern in the city of Concord, called <i>The Harping Minstrel</i>. The interior was very unlike my home, but I managed to make a friend. His name was Orin and he seemed like a strong candidate to help me in my search. We began to discuss my quest, when a very loud individual burst into the tavern. The patrons were being equally loud and rambunctious, so I had a hard time hearing him. 

My new friend and I edged our way closer to the man. He seemed to be talking about something important. He then mentioned the Elf Queen. I had heard of her. Maybe she knew where the High Druid was! I figured I could help if it got me closer to my goal. 

The man gathered up more people to aid him. Apparently, we were to travel to some magical tower to retrieve some kind of weapon that the Elf Queen needed. <i>Maybe this will oblige her to give me information I need,</i> I thought. We also needed to warn them of an attack that might happen. 

Our party as it stood was....
<ol>
<li>Orin, the Barbarian</li>
<li>Kasula, the Rogue</li>
<li>Rorik, the Fighter</li>
<li>Fard, the Bard</li>
<li>and ME!</li>
</ol>

So, we set off down the road towards the magic tower thing. I had a hard time paying attention to the man giving us the mission. As we approached the tower, Rorik halted the party. He said that he noticed some Goblins waiting in the brush. He believed they were waiting to ambush us! I guess the mean Goblins noticed that we had stopped, so they jumped out and began to attack us! This was the first fight I had ever been in! 

I was so scared, but I noticed that there was a clear leader among them. He seemed to have magic in him, and I knew he needed to go! Not wanted to make a fool of myself, I focussed all of my power into an Acid Arrow. After I opened my eyes, the Goblin was gone, and Orin was starting at me. I DID IT! The rest of the Goblins were easy to defeat. We rested after that skirmish, but I was still tired. And my magic didn't feel like it ever came back. I think that spell might have taken a little too much out of me. 

We got to the tower and we met another man named Zanj, second in command to the leader of the tower, Quellis. When we told him our tale, he seemed very concerned at the mention of the Goblins. Apparently, there were magics in place to protect the tower. Why weren't they working? 

We were rushed up to Quellis to explain our tale for a second time. Fard took the lead; he seemed smitten with her. She seemed equally worried about the Goblins. I couldn't understand the big deal. Goblins are easy to kill. Anyways, she sent some Wizards to go and investigate the issue, and we were sent off to rest while the magical weapon was "unbound" from the tower. Geez, they like their magic swords. 

A couple hours later, we're rushed out of bed (rudely I might add), and sent off to investigate a cave system. Some of the tower Wizards sensed some creatures lurking there. I was told that the whole cave system was trapped, and I was the only one who could dispell it. <i>No pressure.</i> 

We take a back road to the cave, but when we get there, the traps have already been set off! There were Goblins corpses everywhere! It was disgusting. The weird thing was that all of the bodies looked burned, but none of the surrounding area did. The magic trap was not a likely culprit here. Out of nowhere, two Goblins ran right past us, and they completely ignored us! I could tell from their faces that they were scared of something, but I had no idea what. Against our better judgement, we decided to enter the caves. 

We continued to explore the caves. We found more dead bodies of Goblins, but we also found some Lizardmen bodies. And they looked like they died fighting eachother. There weren't any weird scortch marks in here. Aside from the corpses, there was a giant hole in the back of the cave (not marked on the map I might add). We investigated further, and the hole appeared to be a makeshift entrance into the cave. There were a bunch of Lizardmen foot prints leading in, and one giant foot print that I recognized from my travels in the wilds: a dragon. 

Realizing the implications, we hurried back to the tower. At the entrance of the cave, we hit a trip wire, and a activated a sonic trap that must have been set behind us. Recovering from the blow, I noticed that my dagger was vibrating slightly. I don't remember that ever happening. I knew that something was happening ahead. I urged everyone to push forward. 

As we came in sight of the tower, we saw the source of the footprint. An enormous bright blue dragon was soaring around the tower causing a great big mess. We picked up our pace, just as Quellis rose form the wreckage of the tower and blew the dragon clear out of the sky with an expertly shot fireball to the wing! Glorious to behold. I thought was victory was at hand as the dragon dropped out of the sky, but I was so wrong. Another figure rose from the tower: **Zanj!**

He struck Quellis from behind <i>the scoundrel!</i> Fard, feeling responsible for her, completely ignored the dragon at the base of the tower and rushed up the tower to face Zanj. We simply followed. We didn't stop at all, as we fought floor after floor of Lizardmen to get to Quellis in time. 

Exhausted, we arrived at the top of the tower (or what was left) to see Zanj repeatedly stabbing Quellis' limp body as part of some kind of ritual. We interrupred him, but then focus was turned to us. We manged to fight him off, but just as the tides were turning, he turned around and struck the final blow against Quellis, killing her. The ritual was complete. 

Power began to surge through the villains's veins. His body contorted and convulsed. With a powerful roar, Zanj transformed into a horrifying dragon-man eldritch monster. He turned his focus back to us with an evil grin at his newly gained power. He attacked Orin with a critical blow, that would kill a normal man. We thought he was dead for a moment, but somehow he managed to find the strength to continue fighting. 

We continued to fight him. We continued to <i>beat</i> him! When he realized that he was no match for us, he thought he could escape on his newly formed wings. Kasula wouldn't have any of that! Reacting quickly, she chased down Dragon-Zanj, jumped on his back and clung to his neck for dear life! With her one free hand, she continued to cut into Zanj's evil throat! As he was about to escape, she struck the final blow! Zanj was defeated, but Kasula was still in danger. As the two were plumetting towards the ground, Kasula summoned magic unknown to me to teleport to us in an instant, just in time to watch Zanj crash! 

Our victory was shortlived though. As Rorik marveled over the weapon Zanj had, we realized that there was still a dragon causing untold damage at the base of the tower. Kasula, as usual, was the first to react. Using rope she had, she repelled down the tower with great haste, and stabbed the dragon in the eye, creating another hold to match the one in his wing! <i>I'm clever.</i>

Rorik and Orin were next to use the rope, but they stumbled on the way down and got caught. Casting Feather Fall on myself, I drifted to the ground to help Kasula in her assault. Shortly thereafter, Orin and Rorik found their way to the ground and began attacking the dragon. Confused already, the dragon focussed on the nearest threats, Rorik and Orin. 

With a mighty roar, the dragon breathed pure lightning onto both Rorik and Orin, badly injuring the both of them. Then, with a great swing of its claws, the drake took struck at Orin, landing a blow near his neck. We all believed that he would again muster the strength to go on. His legs quivered at the blow, and with a heavy and definitive thud, Orin was dead. I will miss him dearly. 

In a rage, Rorik struck the final blow against the fiend. The assult on the tower was over. We had beaten our enemies unscathed....almost.
