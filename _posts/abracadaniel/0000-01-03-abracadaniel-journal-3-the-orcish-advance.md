<h2 class="AbracaDaniel-handwriting">Dear Diary,</h2>

So we continued our journey towards the Court of Stars to turn in Duvin. When we got there, lo and behold, Rorek was there! It was nice to have the group back together. We all meet with the gatekeeper, Balegar. He was very rude, but once we mentioned Quellis, he let us right through. <i>hmph!</i> We met with the Elf Queen. I guess Rorek had separate business with her related to the Dwarf King. Isn't he fancy? Rorek handed her a decorated sealed report. As she read it, her face seemed to drop. It wasn't sadness. She seemed more annoyed than anything. She then announced that a treaty between the Elves and the Dwarves was being resurrected. <i>Such historic times we are in indeed!</i> I guess there were Orcs somewhere nearby and we were being tasked with eliminating them. Sounded fun. We had the night to prepare, shop, and rest before our quest. 

That night, as I slept, something stirred in my hand. I woke up in time to see my dagger floating in front of me. My first thought was that an invisible Orc was trying to kill me with my own weapon. Suddenly, it spoke. I kid you not, <b>it spoke!</b> I heard a voice that resounded with all the grace and beauty of a flowing river. I immediately recognized the voice of the High Druid. I don't remember her exact words. I was a little too scared of the floating, talking dagger to take notes. She acknowledged me as the owner of her dagger. "One of many" she said. My special status was dropping like a dead dragon. I told her that I had meant to return the dagger to her. In fact, I wish I could. She told me to keep it. <i>Such benevolence!</i> Her voice faded away. In its place, I heard another, grumpier voice. It was still coming from the dagger! It was saying something about "not having a spell in it," and not being happy about it. I didn't know that it could hold spells, let alone desire them. Wanting to make my only connection with the High Druid happy, I cast Ray of Frost. Almost immediately, its demeanor (if that makes any sense) changed. It became happy. Almost like it was whole. With that, it stopped floating, and was content to not wake me for the rest of the night. 

Even though the dagger didn't wake me, I got very little sleep. When the High Druid let me keep the dagger, she took away something, too. Returning the dagger was the reason I left home. It was my life up until now. Without that quest, what am I supposed to do now? Go home? No. I've come to far to go back now. I guess the only way is forward, with Kasula, Fard, Rorek and Duvin. They're all I have now. 

<hr>

The next day, we set out to find the Orcs trailing behind almost an entire army of fellow adventurers. I guess there was a hefty bounty on the heads of these Orcs. As we were walking, I thought I smelled a familiar Orc stench. In my zeal to lead the party, I started running towards the source, my party chasing after me. I was running so fast, I didn't hear the sound of a river. I was so focused on that scent. Suddenly, the ground beneath my feat became not so solid, and I fell into a river face first. I then discovered the real source of the smell. A dead body was lying in that river! I had to recover for a moment from that trauma, but before I could, I heard the splashes of my friends all crashing into the river along side of me. <i>What have I done?</i> The sheer foulness of the water made us all ill, but we managed to recover. With that blunder, my leadership position was taken from me. <i>Thank goodness!</i> 

Duvin then took charge, but got us more lost than we originally were! We found ourselves in the territory of a pack of wolves that attacked on sight. After that second blunder, Fard thought he could adequatley lead us, but he was just as wrong as Duvin and I. This time, as if the very forces of nature were against us, <i>how poetic,</i> we were stampeded by squirrels. At that point, I almost lost the will to go on. Seeing our despair, Kasula ran towards the nearest tree and practically lept to the very top! From there, she could see where the Orcs were, and informed us that they were trying to block us in by setting the forest on fire! From her vantage point, she gave us directions to an area not yet ablaze, and we followed her with haste. 

We found ourselves on the shores of another bend in the river in time to see a band of Orcs on the opposite shore. They seemed to be investigating the camp of the Orcs we <u>actually</u> wanted. These were not the Orcs we were looking for. I had spotted them first, but I wasn't sure what to do. I just sat there...like an idiot. 

As I stood there frozen, the Orcs took notice of us. Two of the scarier Orcs made lots of noise on their drums and horns, calling for backup I assume. I was very, very afraid at that point, and decided that I needed to pull out the big guns. While I was planning my attack, Kasula and Rorek waded across the river to better position themselves, and Duvin, Fard, and I walked down stream, closer to the Orc "screamers," and their Shaman leader. 

Suddenly, we were surrounded. Several Orcs (I guess at the sound of the horn) came out of the woods and surrounded Fard and Duvin. Across the river, Kasula and Rorek weren't doing much better. I decided that it was the best time to use my new spell. I focussed all of my energy into it, trying to decide who my targets would be. I needed to thin the group near Fard and Duvin as much as possible, and remove the Orc Shaman. 

First shot: The Shaman goes down without a fight. 
Second shot: A "screamer" goes down.
Third shot: Miss <i>rats!</i>
Fourth shot: Another miss
Final shot: One of the Orcs flanking Fard dies

While I was proud of that spell, I immediately regretted casting it. Seeing his downed leader, one especially fearsome looking Orc came after me, and hit me in my face! Injured, I managed to fend off the Orc with more lesser magic, but that was not the end. I was still a threat to these Orcs. More came. I couldn't hold them off by myself. I don't exactly remember the blow that took me down. It all happened so fast. 

While I was in the void, I saw the High Druid <i>because that's super healthy.</i> We were in the same forest clearing where I saw her for the first time, except this time I saw her face. God, she was so beautiful. She walked slowly towards me, holding my dagger for some reason. As she got closer, her face began to change....become more feral. She was within arm's reach. I could almost touch her. 

Without warning, she took the dagger in her hands, and attacked me! Over and over again, she came at me with the very same dagger that I had held so dear for so long. I thought I was going to die....again.....

"DANNY WE GOTTA GO! GET UP!"

I woke up with Fard's face hovering over me, and the sound of suffering Orcs in the distance. The battle was still going on....I was alive somehow. 

We manage to finish off the rest of the Orcs with no other incident. We recover from the battle in time to see this group of three men walking past us with the Orc leader's (I assume) head on a stick. <i>Barbaric!</i> Seeing that the mission was completed, we resigned to return to town, and oh boy was there a hoot and a holler for those three guys. We got some money for participating, which was nice, but it seemed like Kasula thought something was off about those three men. I didn't see it. 

While we were celebrating with the group, the Elf Queen got a message from a courier: Orcs had gotten word of her treaty with the Dwarf King and were storming on her forts! We were some of the first to volunteer to help defend the fort, along with those weird guys. We were given eagles to ride there. I rode one all by myself, thank you very much! But by the time we got there, we had lost the three guys. Suspicious. 

We managed to defend the fort with relative ease. I managed to attract too much attention again, but my friends helped divide the giant wolf's attention. After the battle, an Elf came and informed us that we had successfully fended off the Orcs...for now. I was pretty happy at that point, especially since they said we could sleep here in the fort for the night. 

Well, I'm tired and don't want to think about anything ever again. G'night!
